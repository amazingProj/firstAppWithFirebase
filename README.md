# Requests to firebase

The user enters details about his travel,
,
including his name, his phone/email, pickup address, destination address
date of travel and optional arrival date if the travel is more than one day.

As we can see here

Using the Google API we translate the addresses into coordinates

The second application will do the opposite process.

After the clicking the travel button, a toast message appears 
if it is succesfully inserted to firebase.

# Firebase - Real time data base 

We use real time data base to insert travel

like we can see in the following picture:

We can see our example travel in the data base

which now can be read by the second application.
